## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to track the history of my [twenty game challenge][challenge]. The twenty game challenge focuses on learning how to make games in 20 games or less. 

[challenge]: https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/

## Goal

For each game, I will create a game design document (GDD), art, and sound effects. There will be a sufficient amount of polish as well as a unique addition (ie upgrades, scoring system, leaderboards). I will document my progress via a devlog that may or may not eventually be published to the web. At the very least, the devlog will be maintained in this repo. 

I will focus on using good coding practices and patterns. I have a CompSci background and even though my title is Senior Software Engineer I have not worked in a typical software engineering enviroment. Given that, I will use this challenge to help me in the following skills:

- Project Planning
- Project Management
- Game Design
- Working with coding patterns
- Documentation
- Asset creation (pixel art, sound fx, music, blender [if necessary])
