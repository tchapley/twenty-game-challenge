I started the project off by setting up the basic structure of the project,
creating the git repo, and the initial concept art. 

Creating the concept art was a fun experience and I like what I was able to
create. I know Pong is a simple game, but creating a full concept of what the
final game look like really gives me an idea of what I'm shooting for. 

I also created a game design document, but since it was my very first, it feels
very underwhelming. I don't know if I'm supposed to add finer details like what
kind of "juice" I want to add. That feels more like a planning aspect and not a
realistic addition to a a GDD.
